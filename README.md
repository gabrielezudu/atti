Hi Jason, thank you for answering; great book! 
I was an absolute beginner when I started reading your book (still am!!), but I managed to create a few good applications using the
examples from the book.    
In this case, I got the basis from the book, and everything worked fine until I decided to create a modal login form; I stripped 
out all the unnecessary from the attached files, but the essence is that I have a controller that displays a view if the user is 
logged in, and another if he's not. But it doesn't work!!i.e., it works if I log in using a traditional form, but it doesn't if 
I use a modal form; and yet, the $_session is correctly set by the modal form...
Maybe it's trivial, but any help or suggestion would be appreciated..
Thanks
